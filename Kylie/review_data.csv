9,1,"The food better be good because the iced coffee is horrible, and the service is deplorable.
Party of 3, sat at the counter when it wasn't overly busy. Waited about 10 minutes for beverages, and then another 15 just to order.
Now we have been waiting for over 30 minutes for our food.
Meanwhile, friends of a server popped in, had drinks in immediately, and magically, their food.
Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else."

I had high hopes for this eatery but I got over that with just one visit. Arrived a little after 12p.m. on a perfectly lovely day with four other adult family members. The restaurant makes a nice impression with it's white beadboard trim and large windows. I'm thinking this is going to be nice. We were seated fairly quickly once they had converted a square table to round to accommodate our party of five. The waitress was friendly and attentive at first. Took our orders, poured our beverages etc. Tick, tock, it took 45 minutes before our food was served! If 5 is a big party, they are in big trouble. But the fun doesn't stop there. Out of 5 entrees there were 3 errors. Mom asked for sausage, she got bacon, Sister asked for multi grain bread, she got sour dough, hubby ordered a Tuscany omelet and got a Western. My tuna melt was accurate but miserably cold. Okay let's go with 4 out 5. My brother-in-law was happy with his Cuban. We're still trying to figure out how that happened. My advice, skip it!!!"
13,1,"Not Impressed at all. Ordered a omelette and bacon.
The bacon was forgotten and never arrived.
Also received a English muffin. No butter or anything. Just a dry sliced muffin. Fresh squeezed orange juice was very disappointing.
Food was dropped off and did not see server again.
Won't be going back again until picking up the plates.
HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT"
14,1,"never coming back here again. all of the glasses had a crusty cloudy look to it. silver ware and coffee cups were all crusty and dirty. waiter spilled coffee all over our table and didnt bother cleaning it up. i ordered the green juice and on the rim of the glass cup it was covered with what looked like rolls of dust and particles. as i ask them to replace it, but instead they just wiped it with a napkin and gave it back to me with particles still covered around it. it looked like they stored the glasses in a very dusty dirty shelf or kept them on a dirty floor. i didnt bother drinking it nor will i come back to this filthy place again. there are flies everywhere in the resturant also."
18,1,"Well, lots to say. Managers were busy makin coffee drinks and totally ignoring the business. Tables were ready and set but empty. The ""15 minute wait"" became 30. People that work there appear to be miserable and in slllloooowwww motion. Waiter brought table next to us their food holding a dirty rag and said ""this is a really hot plate. The heat is coming through this rag.""  Ummm. After seeing and hearing that we were kinda disgusted. Our meal was fair. My skillet was hot but the food was not. Sad- the menu is great but will not return unless a major re-do happens."
28,1,"Nice staff. Painfully slow food service 1st time, 2nd time, and there won't be a 3rd."
37,1,"While the food is good, the service is terrible and the staff is rude. I recommend choosing somewhere else"
38,1,Went to the turning point with our friends today for the first time and it will be our last. We were seated promotly and waited over 50 minutes for breakfast items we ordered. 50 minutes for breakfast and being told the kitchen is really backed up. I could have had our 4 items we ordered done in 10 minutes especially in a commercial kitchen and I am far from a chef. I ordered the basic skillet. Potatoes were over salted and this dish comes with eggs that were over cooked after asking for over easy created an extremely dry dish. Manager comped our meal but was not very friendly. Felt very sorry for our waiter. He was stuck in the middle.  Other breakfast items were only okay and really nothing to rave about. If this place survives I will be amazed unless they change their kitchen crew. Breakfast really is not that difficult or that hard to make. If you fail miserably at making breakfast you probably will not do well at asking anything more difficult.
39,1,"Today I went in expecting a nice family brunch. After waiting we were finally seated and ordered our meal, only to end up sitting for over 50 mins with no food. I went up to talk to the manager, to try and explain how the other table seated much later were able to get their food before us. My husband left church early just to spend time together and had to return back, so we were trying to accommodate. But instead of apologizing and showing signs of concern, the manager's first comment was ""I can pack in to-go box"". We sat for 1 full hour! Really?

So when the food came out, we returned the Reuben sandwich, since my husband was now gone, and upset. 

When we asked for the bill, I got a check for all three orders which was taken care by ""Manger Comp"". 

I understand mistakes can happen. But the way the manager dealt with our situation, was very unkind. He should have been more polite and accommodated us more professionally. It was my first time, and I will probably not go back to this place again, unless they have a more established system working around it. 

We went in there with happy mood, sat there waiting for our food for an hour miserably, only to decide to simply eat and go. The ""comp"" check that was brought to us by the server, and not by the manager himself made it that much more upsetting.  This made myself and my daughter feel upset and we left with a sour feeling about the whole place. 

I plan to take this up to the corporate manager about how we were served by the server and about how things were handled by the manager!  Terrible first time experience here!!!"
40,1,"Horrible experience. First, it was crowded on Father's Day, which we expected. Once we were seated, I notice that the table was wobbling and it spins.  I informed the waitress about the table.  She couldn't do anything about it.  When we got our coffee, I realized that she forgot to give us spoons for the coffee. Finally, our food came. Again, I realized that she forgot to give us our utensils to eat the food.  I had to walk to the front and inform the hostesses that we had no utensils.  Everyone got their food except me.  The chicken with waffles took forever the make.  I will never go here again."
41,1,"Terrible service. Waiting staff is very disorganized, cannot take down the clients name correctly. It's a luxury to get greetings out of them, food is mediocre at best.
Last time we were here waiter delivered wrong order to our table, spilled fruits all over when setting down the plate. Then he quickly picked up the plate and delivered to the right table, I doubt that guest had any clue."
42,1,"I was exited to meet with my bosom friends for brunch at this new joint. Maybe we were more focusing on each other than actual foods. The atmosphere was lively. The food came out rather too  fast and then the waiters and waitress started  coming every 5 minutes to ask if we finished eating or needed anything else etc. We felt like our conversation were constantly interrupted and wound up not finishing foods and left the place to talk at elsewhere. Waisted $50 for waffles, egg Benedict and brunch size salad and coffee in less than an hour. We will never go back."
46,1,"Had been impressed with this place when it first opened. Good food selection, different then other places. But had to walk out this morning because the counter was not cleaned for a good 15 minutes while we sat. We watched others leave as well. Didn't appear to be that crawded so not sure why the poor service. Hopefully they can clean up their act."
49,1,Took forever just to get our coffee. We received one of our breakfasts fairly quickly but my fiancé never got his breakfast so we had to split my omelet. Not worth the money or the service.
52,1,"Having heard about this brunch place from place, we stopped by today for brunch and sadly, didn't go too well. We're vegetarian and ordered a vegetarian dish (zucchini spaghetti) and found a piece of ham in it three quarters of the way through the meal. So although the rest of it tasted pretty good, I would rather have a had a bad tasting meal that didn't have contamination issues. This is pretty unacceptable.

The manager and the waitress were very apologetic and it was obviously not their personal fault. However, it would be if this repeats. Mistakes happen but the biggest mistake would be if this restaurant didn't make a big deal of this error and fix it in a way it never ever repeats for another customer. I strongly suggest that they educate their staff on vegetarianism and food contamination issues. My hope of raising it again here is that it is escalated to the right individuals and receives the attention it deserves."
53,1,The chicken and waffles would of been delicious had it not been served cold. Waited almost an hour and a half for food after being seated. The food has a chance but the service is terrible.
